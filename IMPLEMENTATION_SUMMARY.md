# SAC Priority Application - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Caching System Implementation
- **Feature**: Fast app startup with background API refresh
- **Implementation**:
  - Cache stored in `programs/api_cache.json` with timestamp tracking
  - 5-minute cache duration before refresh
  - Background threading for API updates to prevent UI blocking
  - Automatic cache validation on startup

### 2. VCE-Compliant Priority Algorithm
- **Feature**: Mathematical priority calculation based on VCE principles
- **Implementation**:
  - `calculate_difficulty()`: Relative performance vs target using exponential decay
  - `calculate_urgency()`: Time-based urgency with exponential increase as deadline approaches  
  - `calculate_priority_score()`: Combined difficulty Ã— urgency formula
  - Priority scores now reflect actual VCE study requirements

### 3. Dialog Window Management Fixes
- **Issue**: "Window not viewable" errors with grab_set()
- **Solution**: Implemented delayed grab_set() using `after()` method
- **Result**: All dialog windows (timer, study score, etc.) now display properly

### 4. API-Only Subject Management
- **Feature**: Removed manual subject selector
- **Implementation**: 
  - All subjects now pulled automatically from API
  - Subject list updates in background with cache refresh
  - Streamlined user experience without manual configuration

### 5. Enhanced Progress Cards
- **Feature**: VCE projection display with modern UI
- **Implementation**:
  - Current study score display with visual indicators
  - Target score tracking (defaults to 50/50 for VCE)
  - VCE projection calculations showing required SAC scores
  - Color-coded status indicators (green for on-track, red for needs improvement)
  - Progress bars and percentage completion
  - SAC breakdown buttons for detailed analysis

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Mathematical Formulas Implemented:
```python
# Difficulty Calculation (relative performance)
difficulty = math.exp(-2 * (current_score / target_score))

# Urgency Calculation (exponential time decay)  
urgency = math.exp(-days_until_exam / 7)

# Priority Score (combined formula)
priority = (difficulty + urgency) / 2
```

### Cache Structure:
```json
{
    "timestamp": "2024-07-29T15:30:00",
    "exams": [...],
    "subjects": [...]
}
```

### Background Threading:
- Non-blocking API updates using `threading.Thread`
- UI remains responsive during data refresh
- Automatic error handling for network issues

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Performance**: App opens instantly with cached data
2. **Accuracy**: VCE-compliant priority calculations  
3. **Reliability**: Fixed dialog display issues
4. **Usability**: Streamlined API-only workflow
5. **Modern UI**: Enhanced progress tracking with projections
